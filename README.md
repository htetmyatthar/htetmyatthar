### Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Htet Myat Thar.

- Currently working on [algorithms and datastructures](https://github.com/htetmyatthar/6006) with C, Golang and Python.

- I love C for it's simplicity and love the idea of low level programming.

- I've started with [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023) and 

- I've done almost all the courses, [CS50w](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020), [CS50cybersecurity](https://cs50.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/2023), [CS50p](https://cs50.harvard.edu/p/2022).

- I'm learning Golang to make my portfolio website.

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) user, here's [my config](https://github.com/htetmyatthar/kickstart-nvim).

- Fun fact, the profile is from anime called [The Way Of The Househusband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_the_Househusband). I love the character.
