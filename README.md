### Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is Htet Myat Thar.

Currently working on [algorithms and datastructures](https://github.com/htetmyatthar/6006) with C, Golang and Python.

I love C for it's simplicity and love the idea of low level programming.

I've started with [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023) and 

I've done almost all the courses, [CS50w](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020), [CS50cybersecurity](https://cs50.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/2023), [CS50p](https://cs50.harvard.edu/p/2022).

I'm learning Golang to make my portfolio website.
